### Hey there, I'm JoÃ£o ðŸ‘‹
I am a software engineer living in SÃ£o Paulo (SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil) looking for ways to make the world better through technology.  
  
I'm currently part of the development team at Provi, a fintech that seeks to make education for the job market accessible in Brazil through financing and purchasing courses and bootcamps. Being part of a squad focused on customer conversion, our main focus is to ensure a smooth and good experience for all customers during the purchase journey of an education product.  
  
My role as technical leader of the conversion squad is to engage and help the team through agile software development, build, maintain and improve customer journey projects, think of the best engineering solutions and help when thinking of new products.  
  
We are in a cloud environment looking to improve code quality with code review processes and automated testing. Our main challenge right now is to migrate our back-ends from Heroku to AWS to enable better cost management and scale the company with more autonomy.
